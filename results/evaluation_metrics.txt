Heart Disease Prediction Project
--------------------------------
Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Heart Disease Dataset)
Features used: 13 original features + one-hot encoded categorical features
Final feature count: 18

Models Evaluated:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Best Model: Random Forest Classifier
Parameters:
    n_estimators = 100
    max_depth = 8
    min_samples_split = 2
    min_samples_leaf = 2
    max_features = "log2"
    bootstrap = False
    random_state = 42

Evaluation Metrics (Test Set):
------------------------------------------------------------

Confusion Matrix (Random Forest):
                 Predicted Negative   Predicted Positive
Actual Negative        30                 3
Actual Positive        1                 27

Notes:
- Random Forest achieved the best overall performance across Accuracy, Recall, and F1-score.
- Logistic Regression also performed strongly and is easier to interpret.
- SVM delivered high recall (useful for minimizing false negatives).
- Decision Tree had the weakest performance, but remains interpretable.
- Nominal features were encoded with OneHotEncoder.
- Scaling applied only for Logistic Regression and SVM (not needed for tree-based models).
- A pipeline (preprocessing + model) was saved for reproducibility.
